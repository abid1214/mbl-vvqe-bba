# Exploring MBL via VVQE & BBA

A [Qiskit Summer Jam 2020](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-summer-jam-20) hackathon project

## Physics Background

In the classical world we are used to matter thermally equilibrating with its environment, like a hot cup of coffee cooling down, but in the quantum world there are phases of matter known as many-body localized (MBL) phases that do not equilibrate, like a never-cooling cup of coffee. In this hackathon, we wanted to study MBL using quantum computers. 

## Implementation

We implement two quantum algorithms using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)

* [VVQE](src/vqe/vvqe.py) - Variance Variationial Quantum Eigensolver
* Entropy Measurement [[1]](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aae94a)
  * [Swap Test](src/overlap/swap.py) 
  * [BBA](src/overlap/bba.py)

This opens a new path forward to study MBL with quantum computers!

### Requirements

This was built using Qiskit version `0.19.6`. To read and analyze some of the data we also recommend you use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). 

### Tests

Use `pytest` to run tests
